# Accordion FAQ Schema Toggle

This plugin gives editors the option to generate FAQ Schema JSON-LD markup for any WordPress core Accordion block. This markup will be automatically appended to the page footer. All non-text content inside accordion items is ignored.

Note that at the time of writing, the Accordion block is 'experimental' and requires the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) with .

I made a suggestion on the [Accordion Block issue thread](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584#issuecomment-3302509830) to add this functionality to core, but I'm not confident enough to try and implement it myself. Obviously, if it helps, anybody is more than welcome to take this and add it directly to [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) if they wish üëç.
